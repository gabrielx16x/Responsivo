    With the name "Espaço Unibanco Dragão do Mar", managed by Itaú Unibanco, the activities
    in the cinemas of the Centro Dragão do Mar de Arte e Cultura were started in 1999,
    when the cultural complex was inaugurated. After 13 years, the institution ended its partnerships
    in several movie theaters across the country and, under the brief management of João Soares Neto, the equipment
    changed its name to Cine Dragão do Mar. Closed in 2012, Cinema do Dragão was reopened in
    September 3, 2013, after undergoing a complete structural renovation and acquisition of new
    projection and sound equipment, which currently highlights it as a reference in programming quality
    and exhibition in the city of Fortaleza, with regular actions from Tuesday to Sunday, from 2 pm, between
    screenings of premieres and classics of Brazilian and world cinema, as well as exhibitions and debates.
    The implementation of the restructuring project was the result of the technical and curatorial cooperation agreement
    between the Instituto Dragão do Mar and the Joaquim Nabuco Foundation (Fundaj) in Recife, with expertise of more than
    20 years in the field of film broadcasting and represented by renowned
    programmers Kleber Mendonça Filho and Luiz Joaquim, whose partnership was maintained until 2017.

<h2 class="texto"><strong>Space and equipment</strong></h2>

 
<p class="texto">
    With two movie theaters, one with 122 seats and the other with 174 seats,
    the Cinema do Dragão is equipped with the most modern equipment
    sound system and digital projection of the Barco brand, one of the most respected in the audiovisual market.
    It is the only cinema in Fortaleza with three different types of projection technologies: analogue Cinemecanica,
    equipment used to show films from public and private collections on 35mm film,
    digital 4K (DCI standard), equipment still rarely found in the city that offers a resolution of
    image four times superior to traditional televisions, and with modern sound systems that cover from
    mono/stereo formats up to Dolby 7.1 Surround; and digital laser Barco SP2K-11 2K, with Laser light source for
    a brightness of 11,000 lumens, more modern and more economical.

   In order to support as many media as possible,
   one of the rooms also has a Cinemecanica 35mm analogue projector. With the different systems,
   it is possible to contemplate optical and digital formats, including DOREMI DCP (Digital Cinema Package).
   New Dolby Digital sound system plays movies in mono, stereo, 5.1 and 7.1 formats

<h2 class="texto"><strong>Accessibility</strong></h2> 
 
<p class="texto">
    Cinema do Dragão has the "Cine Watch" feature, a solution capable of providing accessibility
    in movie theaters through the transmission and synchronization of LIBRAS content, audio description
    and caption for an application installed on a mobile device. The equipment allows people to
    deaf and/or blind people watch movies that have this technology. Viewers who need
    feature can request the device at the Box Office and must install the application on their mobile phone.
